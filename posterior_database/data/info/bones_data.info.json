  "description": "34 indicators of skeletal age (SA) for 13 boys aged 6 months to 18 years. Each indicator is\n          categorised with respect to its degree of maturity. 19 are binary \n          (0 immature, 1 mature), 8 are ternary, 1 has 4 grades and 6 have 5\n          grades of maturity. For binary items, there is a single threshold\n          for the Chronological Age where 50% of individuals are mature for that parameter. Ternary\n          items have 2 threshold parameters: first corresponding to the\n          CA where 50% of individuals are partially or fully mature, second where 50% are fully mature., ",
